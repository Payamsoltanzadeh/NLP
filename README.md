# Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

Hello there! I'm **Payam Soltanzadeh**, a passionate Data Science student at the **University of Milan** and an exchange student at **Heidelberg University**. I am deeply interested in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and all things data-driven.

## About This Repository

This repository is my personal space where I share projects, experiments, and assignments related to data science and machine learning. As I continue my academic journey and explore various aspects of data science, you'll find my work evolving over time.

### The NLP Folder

I have created an **`nlp`** folder specifically to host all my NLP projects. Here, I plan to upload a variety of projects that demonstrate my work in processing and analyzing natural language data, including:
- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Language modeling
- And much more!

Feel free to explore, learn, and even suggest improvements or collaborations.

## Get in Touch

I’m always open to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about data science and NLP, please feel free to reach out.

Happy coding and exploring!

— **Payam Soltanzadeh**
