# NLP Yelp Reviews Classification Project

Welcome to my NLP project repository! This project is part of my Data Science studies at Uni Milano. In this project, I explore NLP techniques to classify Yelp reviews into 1-star and 5-star reviews.

## Project Overview

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** Loading and preparing the Yelp reviews dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing review length distributions, star rating counts, and feature correlations.
- **NLP Pipeline Construction:** Building a pipeline with `CountVectorizer`, `TfidfTransformer`, and a Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Splitting data, training the model, and evaluating performance.
