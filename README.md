# NLP Yelp Reviews Classification Project

Welcome to my NLP project repository! This project is part of my studies in Data Science at Uni Milano, where I explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify Yelp reviews into 1-star and 5-star reviews.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on:

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:**  
  Loading a Yelp reviews dataset, analyzing its structure, and preparing it for further analysis.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualizing data distributions using histograms, boxplots, and count plots to understand review characteristics.
  
- **NLP Pipeline Construction:**  
  Building a pipeline that includes text vectorization with `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer`, and implementing a classification model using Naive Bayes.

- **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
  Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the model, and evaluating its performance with metrics like confusion matrices and classification reports.
